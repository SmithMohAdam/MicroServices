# MicroServices
## summary
In this app, I applied the basic concepts of microservices architecture 
using spring boot, and spring cloud "Eureka Server and Eureka Client ".
Spring Cloud applied client-side service discovery 

This  app contains three microservices that work as a client, and the server consumes those microservices 
The first service is the movie info service
The second service is the movie rating service
The third one is the movie rating service 

## Coming Up
I will extend this app to contain sign-up and sign-in services
and dockerize this app to be running in containerized system like docker, Kubernetes, and openShift

Used technology
### java , spring boot , spring cloud , Eureka
